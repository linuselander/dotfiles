This script will install dotfiles into $HOME
Installation will backup your existing dotfiles to current_dir/backup
Every time install is run it will begin by trying to uninstall.
This will guarantee the integrity of the original backups.

$ ./setup.sh [--install | --uninstall]

--install     Begins by running uninstall and then it makes backups
              of all affected files in '$HOME' and stores them in a
              separate folder. Then symlinks are created pointing
              to corresponding files in this folder.
              Install will also download all required plugins.
              It will begin by git cloning Vundle.vim and then run
              PluginInstall from within the vim context.

--uninstall   Removes the symlinks and restores the original files.
              Uninstall will not remove downloaded plugins.
